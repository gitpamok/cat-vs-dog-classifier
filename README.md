# cat-vs-dog-classifier

**Problem statement** :

In this project, I have implemented Convolution Neural Network(CNN) Classifier for Classifying dog and cat images. The Total number of images available for training is 25,000 and final testing is done on seperate 10,000 images.

This problem statement and dataset is taken from this [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) competition.

**Convolutional Neural Network**

In deep learning, a convolutional neural network is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks, based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics.
